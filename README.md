# hello-world
A short description...

... or an unnecessarily lengthy and overly-involved description delving into the unimportant details of a file that perhaps no one will ever read for the sake of momentary entertainment (that measures mild at best on any scale) in order to distract one's self from any amount of required, or otherwise arbitrarily more usefull, work.


Sincerely,

Dr. README.md
